## Uses for the Application
Like many FPS games, Overwatch uses its own native sensitivity settings along with a users mouse DPI to allow a character to produce movement. Sensitivity varies heavily based on the game, so it is necessary to standardize an input method to achieve some form of normality. This can be accomplished by understanding how many centimeters of mouse movement it takes to move your character in one 360 degree rotation. 

## How to Use the Application
To use this application, enter both your mouse DPI and your Overwatch in-game sensitivity then click the orange button. Your mouse DPI can be found in whichever software configured your mouse, and the in-game sensitivity can be found on the "Options" screen within Overwatch. After you click on the blue "Compute cm/360°" button, the application will calculate the cm/360° needed to complete a full character rotation. 

## Understanding your cm/360° Result 
A valid way to interpret your own cm/360° result from this program is to compare it to the settings from professional Overwatch players.
A spreadsheet is available [here](http://on-winning.com/overwatch-pro-sensitivity-settings-setups-monitor-mouse-keyboard-headset/).

As the cm/360° is universal, the output can be understood despite varying hardware/software setups, and is a valid way to interpret sensitivity settings with other players. Personally, I play on 1000 DPI with 6.5 in-game sens, which equates to 21.31 cm/360°. This means that I have to move my mouse 21.31 cm for my in-game character to achieve one full 360 degree rotation. These settings are very similar to [Saebyolbe's](http://liquipedia.net/overwatch/Saebyeolbe) (professional player for team [New York Excelsior](http://liquipedia.net/overwatch/New_York_Excelsior)), even though he plays at 810 DPI and 7.93 in-game sens! For reference, this is a very high sensitivity, most players are around the mid 30's range.
